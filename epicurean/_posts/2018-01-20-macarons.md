I decided to clear out my baking bucket list and tackle all the time-consuming desserts I've been itching to make. My first conquest: the French macaron.

I consulted several different recipes to learn techniques and tips:

- [Macarons - King Arthur Flour](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/macarons-recipe)
- [Classic French Macaron with vanilla buttercream filling](https://www.aheadofthyme.com/2017/02/classic-french-macaron-with-vanilla-buttercream-filling/)

- [How To Make French Macarons (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JeTgZGt-p8)
- [French Chocolate Macarons Recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UlEZMbeO5Q)

I settled on following along with a [YouTube recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJ636Y8N6E8) as I wanted to see what each step looked like. It worked out pretty well, but I think I would try to be a little more adventurous the next time.

It took me two tries to get the batter to the right consistency. The first time, I missed an ingredient and didn't whip my eggs long enough so I had a liquidy batter. The second time around I achieved a batter that was a little thicker and produced beautiful feet.

My oven runs hot, so I wish I had set the temperature a little lower and then allow for a longer baking time. I had trouble with the bottoms starting to brown. Otherwise, I think they came out pretty good for a first try!
