As a farewell to summer, I made [one more ice cream](/epicurean/summer-of-ice-cream): the dark & stormy.

[Ginger ice cream](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/anne-burrell/ginger-ice-cream-recipe-3381845) and [rum caramel sauce](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/spiced-rum-sauce-105704), garnished with a [candied lime](https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/candied-key-limes-and-lime-syrup/11132/) &mdash; a deliciously smooth combination that pairs well with a lobster roll.

(I highly recommend adding the zest of a whole lime to the ice cream batter.)
