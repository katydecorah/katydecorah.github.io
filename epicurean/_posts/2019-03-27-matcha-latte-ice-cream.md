This week we visited [Gracie's](https://www.graciestruckny.com/) in Leeds, NY where I had a delicious iced matcha latte sweetened with vanilla and coconut milk. Inspired, I made matcha latte ice cream.

## Ingredients

- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 ½ cups heavy cream
- 1 ½ cups unsweetened coconut cream
- 2 - 3 tablespoons matcha (green tea powder)
- ⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 vanilla bean
- 6 eggs yolks

## Steps

1. Whisk together **heavy cream**, **coconut cream**, **¼ cup sugar**, **matcha**, and **sea salt** in a medium saucepan. Split **vanilla bean** lengthwise and scrape in seeds; add pod.
2. Once bubbles begin to form around the edge of the pan, remove from heat. Taste custard and add a tablespoon of matcha or sugar if desired.
3. Cover and let steep for 30 minutes.
4. Whisk **egg yolks** and **¼ cup sugar** in a medium bowl until pale, about 2 minutes.
5. Gradually whisk in ½ cup warm cream mixture. Whisk yolk mixture into remaining cream mixture.
6. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until thick enough to coat a wooden spoon.  (Mixture should reach about 170°F.)
7. Strain custard into a medium bowl set over a bowl of ice water; let cool for about an hour, stirring occasionally.
8. Process custard in an ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.
9. Transfer to an airtight container. Freeze until firm, at least 4 hours and up to 1 week.
