As I write this, I have already eaten two [pains au chocolat](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1022057-pain-au-chocolate) (chocolate croissants). I have never had a proper croissant fresh out of the oven and it was one of the most delicious experiences so I made sure to have it twice.

This was my second try at croissants. Two weeks ago, I pulled the croissants from the oven and was greeted with a puddle of butter. (Fortunately, the loss of butter made for delicious bisuits.) My luck turned today after giving them ample proving time.
