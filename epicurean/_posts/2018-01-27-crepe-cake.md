I love making crepes, so I've had my eye on a crepe cake for a while. I found the crepe batter had a bit of a learning curve to get right. Thankfully, the batter was generous and allow for several oops crepes.

When assembling, I tried to be clever by adding more space between the edge of the crepe and the center of the spread filling. My thought was that the weight of the subsequent layers would smoosh the lower layers out. This was not the case. I wish I had brought the lower layers filling closer to the edge so the cake would be a little bit more level around the edges.

The cake still came out very pretty!
