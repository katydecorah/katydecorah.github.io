I turned one of my favorite cookies into ice cream. While this dairy-free treat is not as creamy as traditional ice cream, I really loved how well the flavors came together with the granola topping.

## Ingredients

- 6 large egg yolks
- ⅔ cup white sugar
- 1 T cinnamon
- 1 vanilla bean
- 3 cups oat milk
- ⅛ teaspoon fine sea salt
- 3 ounces chocolate chunks, chopped

## Steps

1. Combine **sugar** and **cinnamon**.
2. Whisk together the **egg yolks** and **cinnamon sugar** in a saucepan over medium heat until well-blended. Split **vanilla bean** lengthwise and scrape in seeds; add pod.
3. Continuously stir the egg mixture with a wooden spoon until thickened, 7 to 8 minutes. The mixture should be thick enough to coat the back of the spoon. (Mixture should reach about 170°F.)
4. Remove the mixture from heat and stir in the **oat milk** until smooth.
5. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve set over a clean bowl.
6. Stir in **sea salt**.
7. Cover and chill the mixture in the refrigerator, stirring occasionally until cool, about 1 hour.
8. Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer’s directions. When the ice cream is almost finished, add the **chocolate** into the machine and allow to incorporate completely.
9. Freeze for at least 2 hours or overnight.

While the ice cream sets, make the granola topping. I recommend [Martha Rose Shulman's recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1014414-granola), I omitted the raisins and oat bran since I didn't have any on hand.
