Heavily inspired by [Masterclass](http://www.pbs.org/food/features/great-british-baking-show-season-masterclass/), I attempted a [Kransekake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kransekake) for this year's holiday treat. I owe my success to an inexpensive sausage stuffer that helped me create uniform rings and made it a breeze to bake and assemble. I decorated it with candied cranberries and rosemary.

(Oh, and I filled it with M&Ms.)
