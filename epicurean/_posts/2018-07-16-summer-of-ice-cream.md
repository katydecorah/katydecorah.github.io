For the past month, I've tried a new ice cream recipe with ingredients from the farmers market.

A few tips and notes:

- I have this bad (well, delicious) habit of replacing all the dairy in ice cream recipes with heavy cream only. It's more calories, but I find it keeps the ice cream from getting an icy/frozen taste and gives you a smooth taste.
- Use a rubber spatula on the pan once you mix the egg yolks with the cream. If you don't scrape well, you risk making an omelette on the bottom of your pan.
- Use fresh eggs. It makes a huge difference.

Here's what I made:

## Honey lavender

I followed the advice of a few commenters and used about half of the prescribed honey (since it was local) and it turned out great.

## Strawberry basil

No deviations or recommendations. This recipe was 👌.

## Toasted almond and cherry swirl

I borrowed bits from two recipes: [Toasted almond recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016628-almond-ice-cream) and [cherry swirl recipe](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/raspberry-swirl-ice-cream.html)

I recommend not mixing the caramelized toasted almonds into the batter and instead using it as a topping. (And use sea salt on those caramelized almonds, you won't regret it!) I didn't bother with the almond extract as I thought the batter had the right amount of flavor.

## Blueberry vanilla and lemon curd ripple

Again, I borrowed from two recipes: [Blueberry recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/4730-blueberry-ice-cream) and [lemon curd recipe](http://thepioneerwoman.com/food-and-friends/lemon-curd-ripple-ice-cream/)

For the blueberries, I blended and strained them before cooking to get a smooth texture. I also steeped the vanilla bean in the batter for an hour before I chilled it, which I found complimented the blueberry tartness beautifully.
