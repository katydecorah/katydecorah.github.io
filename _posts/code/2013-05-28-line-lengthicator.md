I'm always trying to find the optimal line length for my text. After reading [several](http://webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Horizontal_Motion/2.1.2/ "The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web") [posts](http://trentwalton.com/2012/06/19/fluid-type/ "Trent Walton: Fluid Type"), I found that the sweet spot is around 66 characters. While styling my paragraphs I started counting the characters manually. That got old, real fast.

So I created this little tool. Copy a paragraph and paste it into the box. It will automatically highlight the 66th character. You can adjust the character length to get a better feel for your readability. It will also tell you the width of the container to help you adjust your own CSS.
