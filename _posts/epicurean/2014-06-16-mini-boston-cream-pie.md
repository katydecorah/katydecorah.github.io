For Father's Day, I made our dads their very own 3&#8243; Boston Creme Pie.

Just a couple weeks ago, I picked up a set of 3 3&#8243; spring form pans. They came in handy for this recipe, which is for a standard 9&#8243; pie. I had exactly enough batter and more than enough icing and filling to make 3 little pies.

Each pie fit perfectly in a 4-cupcake box.

Mini-cakes are my new jam.
