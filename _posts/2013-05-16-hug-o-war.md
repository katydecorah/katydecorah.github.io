I came in second place during week one season two of the [CodePen Rodeo](http://blog.codepen.io/rodeo/season-two/)!

The challenge was to typeset Shel Silverstein's poem *Hug O' War* using only typography and color.

I knew I wanted my poem to be clean and easy to read, but I needed it to be secretly cute. For every fun verb or word (marked with a light dotted bottom border), I created a special CSS animation executed on hover. Giggles is my favorite!

I thought it was really nice how many people came out to vote!
