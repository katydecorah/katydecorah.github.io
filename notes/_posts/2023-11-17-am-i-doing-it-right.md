title: How do I know if I'm doing it right?

Earlier this year, I migrated a project to use web components. Throughout the entire process, I worried that I was doing it wrong. I started to consider how I might validate my assumptions.

- **Where can you find trusted documentation and examples?** For web projects, I start with [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [web.dev](https://web.dev/), these sites are well maintained, cited, and beginner friendly. While you could go right to the technology's specification, I find that these sites help explain the source material through practical use cases. Documentation does expire; check to see when the page was published or last updated. If it was over a year ago, then you will want to check if there's been changes to the technology since then.

- **Is there a linter?** If you're working in a programming language, then there is likely a linter that can help guide you. If I'm starting a new JavaScript or TypeScript project, I check to see if there's an accompanying plugin and then I will install it and enable the recommended configuration. Plugins have helped me improve my [Jest tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jest) and [learn web component best practices](https://github.com/43081j/eslint-plugin-wc). Linters are excellent teaching tools and guides.

- **What other tools can give you signal?** If you're building with a new framework, tools that measure performance like [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) and [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) can give you hints if you're compromising on performance, accessibility, and many other metrics. These tools will challenge your assumption that your project works because &ldquo;it works for me&rdquo;, towards making your project more inclusive.

- **How can I simplify this function? And other AI prompts (proceed with caution).** If you have access to AI tools like [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), you can ask how to simplify your code or make it more readable. However, if you are an absolute beginner to whatever you are learning, be skeptical of guidance generated by AI; it can confidently lead you in the opposite direction.

Additionally, next time you are in the same space as someone in your industry, consider asking &ldquo;How do you stay up-to-date?&rdquo; This question can help you can learn from how they learn. Chances are you will learn a new source for information or validate your current learning path.
