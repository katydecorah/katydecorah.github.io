title: How do I know if I'm doing it right?

Earlier this year, I migrated a personal project to use web components. Throughout the entire process, I worried that I was doing it wrong. I started to consider how I might validate my assumptions especially as a self-learner.

- **Where can you find trusted documentation and examples?** For web projects, I start with [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [web.dev](https://web.dev/), these sites are well maintained, cited, and beginner friendly. While you could go right to the technologyâ€™s specification, I find that these sites help explain the source material through practical use cases. Documentation does expire; check to see when the page was published or last updated. If it was over a year ago, then you will want to check if there's been changes to the technology since then.

- **Is there a linter?** If you're working in a programming language, then there is likely a linter that can help guide you. When starting a new JavaScript or TypeScript project, I check for an accompanying plugin and then enable it with the recommended configuration. Plugins have helped me improve my [Jest tests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jest), and learn [web component](https://github.com/43081j/eslint-plugin-wc) and [TypeScript](https://typescript-eslint.io/) best practices. Linters are excellent teaching tools and guides.

- **What other tools can give you signal?** If you're building with a new framework, tools that measure performance like [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) and [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) can give you hints if you're compromising on performance, accessibility, and many other metrics. These tools will challenge your assumption that your project works because &ldquo;it works for me&rdquo;, towards making your project more inclusive.

- **&ldquo;How can I simplify this function?&rdquo; And, proceed with caution, other AI prompts.** If you have access to AI tools like [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), you can ask how to simplify your code or improve its readability. However, if you are an absolute beginner to whatever you are learning, be skeptical of guidance generated by AI; it can confidently lead you in the opposite direction.

- **&ldquo;How do you stay up-to-date?&rdquo;** Next time you are in the same space as someone in your industry, consider asking this question to learn from how they learn. Chances are you will learn a new source for information or validate your current learning path.

- **How are others doing it?** After checking out trusted documentation to get a sense for the patterns, search for tutorials on your subject. Tutorials on personal sites are a gift as they can often provide raw feedback and examples that may more closely match your use case. You'll want to use the tutorial's material thoughtfully and consider finding an additional source to help verify content.

And once you have learned something new, you should consider writing about it.
