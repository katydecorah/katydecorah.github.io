Some of my favorite work days start with an activity that puts me in a good mood. Here are some vetted suggestions.

- Walk around your neighborhood while listening to an audiobook
- Exercise with friends in a garage
- Take your significant other out for a coffee and a walk
- Go for a trail hike
- Start a marinade so you can throw it on the grill after work
- Make bubble tea
- Make buttermilk biscuits
- Practice skateboarding
- Go blueberry picking
- Play basketball
- Make donuts
- Visit a new bakery or caf√©
- Play pickleball
- Meet someone for breakfast
- Take a nap
- Weed the garden
