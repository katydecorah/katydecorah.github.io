I've been watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer as a first time watcher. The comparison of what's old and new is a strong theme in the series, and of course, the power of magic.

- The librarian and self-appointed Luddite; The teen computer whiz.
- The male perception of strength; teen girls fighting villains.
- The library as an institution of books; the growth of the Internet in the 90s.
- Magic read from books; magic researched and shared online.

The references to the internet and computers feel campy now, but it's hard to miss that the wonder of the 90s internet felt and continues to feel like magic.

If you work on the web, it's likely that someone has compared your work to sorcery or your skills to magic. I've heard arguments that magical comparisons diminishes one's knowledge, but I'm beginning to disagree. Whether my code can make life easier by automating a small process or build an entire career that allows them to pay off a six figure student loan debt, these acts can close a space between what someone has and what they need.

What changes when magic is shared online versus requires access to research libraries? What happens when code is documented?

Share some magic today.
