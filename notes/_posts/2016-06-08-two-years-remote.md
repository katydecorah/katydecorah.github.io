I have entered my ~~terrible~~ terrific twos of working remotely. Working from yoga pants. Working from couch. Working from over the sink as I eat leftovers. The glamour. The rolling out of bed. The "I'm going to wake up early and walk, lol jk."

Last year, I talked about [lessons learned](/notes/one-year-remote/) and this year I'd like to focus on communication. Here's how I've made working miles away from my team feel like inches:

1. **Emote.** :wave: :clap: :sparkling_heart: :sparkles: :+1: :tada:
2. **Avoid sarcasm.** Sarcasm pros: I am funny. Sarcasm cons: I'm making a situation unproductive, draining a person's emotional resources, and potentially adding bricks to a wall that rests between my team and me.
3. **Always be updating.** It's like the [most dangerous game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Most_Dangerous_Game) except I'm hunting me. Can I keep my tickets and pull requests updated before someone asks me for an update or asks what the next actions are?
4. **Know thine words.** I started using [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/), the saver of butts, to gut and spell check my prose. Grammarly reminds me to avoid _it_ and _this_ aka clear writing foes.
5. **Use these phrases more:** How are you? What are you doing this weekend? Thank you! You are welcome. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. What can I take off your plate? I need help. Great job!
