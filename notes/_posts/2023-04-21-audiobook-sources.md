This is my favorite question.

## Local library via the Libby app

Many libraries offer ebooks and audiobooks through [OverDrive](https://www.overdrive.com/) and their app, [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/shelf). To begin borrowing and holding books, all you need is your library card.

If your library does not have a book that you want or in the format you want, you can recommend the book to your library from Overdrive. If your library adds it to their collection, it will automatically be added to your holds. I've been impressed with how often this feature works!

If you are a New York State resident, you can apply for a [New York Public Library](https://www.nypl.org/help/library-card/terms-conditions) and [Brooklyn Public Library](https://www.bklynlibrary.org/use-the-library/ecard-faqs) card. Both have significantly larger collections than my local library.

## Libro.fm

If there's a book I can't wait for, I'll buy it through [Libro.fm](https://libro.fm/). This service supports your local independent bookstore. You also have full access to the audio files once you buy them.

## Apple Books

If I can't get a book through my library or Libro.fm, or I know I want a book that will fully sync to my Apple Watch, I'll buy the book through [Apple Books](https://www.apple.com/apple-books/).
