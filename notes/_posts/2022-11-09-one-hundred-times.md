I think you should do something 100 times. Choose something you enjoy, figure out how you will track it, and then do it 100 times.

You could&hellip;

- Read 100 books.
- Make 100 new recipes.
- Read 100 blog posts.
- Listen to 100 new artists.
- Ride your bike 100 times.
- Go for 100 walks.
- Draw 100 pictures.
- Listen to 100 podcasts.
- Play 100 Wordle games.
- Write 100 haiku.

This year I read 100 books and made 100 new recipes. I didn't intend to do either thing 100 times, but I enjoy both. Since I had [a way to track](https://katydecorah.com/code/build-your-metadata-library/), the goal felt self-propelled. This year I discovered my favorite book genres and that I am starting to prefer vegetarian dishes.

Give yourself a century, because maybe you haven't found your favorite thing ever yet.
