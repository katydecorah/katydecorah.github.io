title: My year with audiobooks
---

This was the year of reading for me. My goal was to follow [Roxane Gay's Audacious book club](https://audacity.substack.com/p/so-it-begins) and then [I kept going](/has/read/#2021). I soon learned that a 30 minute morning walk paired with an audiobook makes me feel right for the day.

Listening to a book while doing anything else is like a delightful cheat. This year I listened to books while:

- Running errands
- Making dinner
- Picking up around the house
- Brushing my teeth
- Rolling around on the foam roller
- Walking, jogging, and bike riding
- Waiting in line for my PCR test
- Shaving my legs in the sink
- Crocheting

Prove them wrong, prove them all wrong, you can fill the void with audiobooks.

You too can try to fill the void with audiobooks.

I have tried to fill the gaps in my life with the voices of those much smarter than me, than you're right.
