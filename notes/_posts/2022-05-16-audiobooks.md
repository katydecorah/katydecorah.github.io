Last year, I met my goal of reading 52 books in 52 weeks and then some. I couldn't have done it without audiobooks, [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby), learning that New York State residents can [apply for the New York Public Library card](https://www.nypl.org/library-card/new).

Listening to a book while doing anything else is like a delightful cheat. I listen to books while:

- Running errands
- Making dinner
- Picking up around the house
- Brushing my teeth
- Completing lengthy skincare regiments
- Rolling around on the foam roller
- Walking, jogging and bike riding
- Waiting in line for my PCR test
- Shaving my legs in the sink
- Crocheting
- Emptying the dishwasher
- Working on jig saw puzzles
- Gardening
- Coloring
- Playing [Threes](http://play.threesgame.com/) on my phone

Prove them wrong, all wrong. You can fill the void with audiobooks.
