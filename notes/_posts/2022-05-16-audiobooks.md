Last year, I met my goal of reading 52 books in 52 weeks and then some. I owe it all to audiobooks, mainly, but also [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby), friends with great book suggestions, [Roxane Gay's audacious book club](https://audacity.substack.com/p/so-it-begins?s=r), and learning that New York State residents can [apply for a New York Public Library card](https://www.nypl.org/library-card/new).

Listening to a book while doing anything else is like a delightful cheat. I listen to books while:

- Running errands
- Making dinner
- Picking up around the house
- Brushing my teeth
- Completing lengthy skincare regiments
- Rolling around on the foam roller
- Walking, jogging and bike riding
- Waiting in line for my PCR test
- Shaving my legs in the sink
- Crocheting
- Emptying the dishwasher
- Working on jig saw puzzles
- Pulling weeds in the garden
- Coloring
- Playing [Threes](http://play.threesgame.com/) on my phone
- Pruning my Libby holds and tags

Prove them all wrong, you can fill the void with audiobooks. (Or at least try to.)
