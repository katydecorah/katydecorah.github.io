Years ago on an episode of [Iron Chef America](https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/iron-chef-america), [Rachel Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachael_Ray) said she is a cook, not a chef. I carried this distinction with me, especially as it relates to web developers and software engineers.

This year my title at work is software engineer. I felt self conscious about it because I don't have a traditional tech background and I am not sure when I became eligible for the title. Over the years I have held many, starting with Neopets user, then Xanga theme developer, web designer, instructional designer, web developer, frontend developer, and then frontend engineer.

The [Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) defines the following nouns:

- `cook`: a person who prepares food for eating
- `developer`: a person or company that develops computer software
- `chef`: a skilled professional cook
- `engineer`: a person who is trained in or follows as a profession a branch of engineering

How does one go from being a person who _prepares_ or _develops_ to being a _professional_?

<!-- extra-eyes ignore type paid -->

- Have certain degrees?
- Know certain languages?
- Be paid by certain companies?
- Live, laugh, love?
- Know someone who can make a job referral?
- Tile your bathroom in GitHub contribution graph green?
- Consistently make stuff on the web year after year?
- Pour La Croix in libation to the gods?
- Type "software engineer" in your LinkedIn profile?

I take pride in all the titles I have held in my journey and maybe that is all I need to feel eligible.
