Saturday morning we visited the Albany Pine Bush at [Karner Barrens East &amp; West](https://www.albanypinebush.org/recreation-center/trails-maps-and-conditions). We took the blue trail to the yellow. Despite the chill, it was a really nice 2.6 mile hike and it only took us about an hour.

On Sunday, I met up with my mom for lunch at Abuelo's, a new Cuban restaurant in Fort Edward. I had the chorizo over rice and it was fantastic.

After lunch we checked out the [Spa City Farmers' Market](http://spacitymarket.com/test/) in Saratoga. I picked up a pair of butternut squash, kale, and baklava.
