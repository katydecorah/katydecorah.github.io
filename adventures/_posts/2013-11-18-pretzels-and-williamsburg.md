Saturday night I had an all out snack attack. Right before heading to the store to pick-up rice krispies treat supplies, my boyfriend asked for pretzels. So I added yeast to my list.

I was kind of grumpy as I was making the pretzels, because I thought I was doing a bad job. As soon as the dough warmed up, it was much easier to manipulate.

And oh my, they tasted _amazing_ fresh out of the oven.

Sunday morning we drove down to the Beacon rail station and took the 10:12 AM train to Grand Central Station. We were headed to Williamsburg for the night to see Knapsack play. Unfortunately, we chose the weekend that the L train was out of service, so we fumbled around the subway until we caved and summoned a car via Uber. It was our first Uber experience and we both loved it.

We got a place for the night on Airbnb in Williamsburg.

Well designed, elevator entrance, amazing views, and a giant fluffy bed. It was perfect.

After we rested for a few minutes, we set out. We visited the Poler pop-up shop and had a great late lunch at [Pies'n'Thighs](http://piesnthighs.com/).

Next we slowly meandered back to the apartment and rested before we headed to the Music Hall. Before we left the building, we checked out the view from the roof.

We had a few minutes to kill before the show started, so we explored a bit more.

After the show, which was fantastic, we headed for a late night dinner at [The Meatball Shop](http://www.themeatballshop.com/).

In the morning, we packed up and headed to [Blue Bottle Coffee](http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/) for a quick breakfast (and you know I got that smore). Then we headed into Manhattan for some more wandering. We walked around Times Square, grabbed lunch at Shake Shack, and checked out a few stores.

We had a really great time.
