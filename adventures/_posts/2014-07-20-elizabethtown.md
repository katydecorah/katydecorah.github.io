This weekend we stayed with friends in Lewis. On Saturday we woke up early to catch the town-wide garage sales in Elizabethtown in the spirit of E-town Day. Our haul included: 1 over-sized sweater, 2 books, and 3 hats.

In the afternoon we took a little excursion out to Lake Champlain and Ausable Chasm.

That night we threw a couple blankets down on the E-town golf course and enjoyed the fireworks.

Hot tubs, pools, coconut rum, good company, and poor cell phone service make for a top-notch Summer weekend.
