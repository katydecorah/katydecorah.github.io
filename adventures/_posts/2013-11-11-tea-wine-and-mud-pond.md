## Tea

On Sunday, mom and I went to lunch at the [Whistling Tea Kettle](http://www.thewhistlingkettle.com/) in Ballston Spa. She had the Connie's baked apple pie tea and I had the vanilla chai.

After lunch, we walked around town and stopped in Wheats & Sweets for a giant cookie.

## Wine

My cousin Kaylee works at [Oliva Vineyards](http://olivavineyards.com/) in Fort Edward. We stopped in for a wine tasting after exploring Ballston Spa. We enjoyed six different wines and both bought a bottle of the _Pretty Filly Ros&#233;_ (the bottle included a little kit to make mulled wine).

The vineyard is also home to thoroughbred horses.

Mom got this great shot of me just as I was giggling, "My hand went in his mouth!"

## Nassau Mud Pond Preserve

On Monday, my boyfriend and I drove out to Nassau to explore the new Mud Pond Preserve. It was an 1.2 mile round trip through the woods, ending at an overlook of Mud Pond. We were in and out in under 40 minutes.

The view of the pond wasn't clear, but the trail was decent. The trailhead was well marked and included a large parking area. The trail is located at 591 Central Nassau Road next door to the town dump.
