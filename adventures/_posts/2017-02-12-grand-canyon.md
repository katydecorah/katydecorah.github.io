To celebrate my birthday (and to mitigate cabin fever), J and I headed to the Grand Canyon.

## Hoover Dam

We landed in Las Vegas on Friday, picked up the rental car, and drove about 40 minutes to the Hoover Dam.

## Grand Canyon Village

On Saturday we packed up and drove the four and half hour to the Grand Canyon Village.

We stayed at [El Tovar](http://www.grandcanyonlodges.com/lodging/el-tovar/), conveniently located right on the South Rim, for three nights. The area experience several back-to-back snowstorms which meant that the conditions were icy and left little chance for hiking (that didn't involve lots of snow gear). Fortunately, we were able to drive up and down the South Rim and enjoy the views from the many scenic pull-offs and overlooks.

We spent the last night in Las Vegas on my birthday. Even though we're not into gambling, we turned a $100 bill from our wedding into $300 on the Roulette table. We blew it all on dinner.
