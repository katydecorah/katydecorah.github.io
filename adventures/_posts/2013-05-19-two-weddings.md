I had the distinct honor of being in two weddings this month.

For both weddings, I designed t-shirts for the bachelorette parties. The bride's (below) is actually a giant nightie (this was her favorite garment in college) and she wore it while getting ready on the day.

Two straight weekends of friends, traveling, hotels, champagne, and good ole fashion dance offs.
