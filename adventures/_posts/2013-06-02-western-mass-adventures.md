This weekend we woke up early and drove out to North Adams, Massachusetts. We took a 20-minute muddy hike through the woods and ended up at a waterfall.

The waterfall sits in two large embankments, which were not to be easily climbed. So we took off our shoes and carefully walked up the stream to the waterfall. The rocks were so smooth and the water cold. As we got closer the mist from the waterfall drenched us and the roar of the water vibrated our ears.

We left to find the train tunnel. Ate lunch at a Greek pizza shop in town and enjoyed whoopee pies at a local caf√©.

On the way home, we climbed the Grafton fire tower. The view was spectacular.

On Sunday, I visited my parents. My mom and I went on a utility trail off of Blanchard Road in Wilton, NY. Toward the end, we found a trail into the woods (unadorned with POSTED signs).

Scattered thunderstorms ended any hope of taking the kayaks out, so we ran a few errands. My mom had seen some pictures in the local newspaper of a pond in a local cemetery with "unusual birds." We drove over and found just that: a Chinese or African Goose (a domestic goose).
