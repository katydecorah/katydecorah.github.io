## Lake Placid

On Monday, I drove up to Lake Placid to visit my college roommate. We went out to dinner, caught a movie, and walked around the lake. The next morning I drove into town for breakfast and did one last lap around the lake. It was a short trip, but well worth it.

## Thousand Islands

On Wednesday, my family and I drove out to Thousands Islands. We checked out the area and took a boat to Rock Island. The next day we drove into Canada to go to the 1000 Islands Sky Deck.

## Portsmouth, NH

For the weekend, my sister and I stayed in Portsmouth, NH. We booked an awesome apartment on Airbnb. The apartment was a short walk from downtown. On Saturday we posted up at the beach. We walked into town every morning for breakfast and every night for dinner. We had an excellent time.

I don't take vacations often, so I think I felt the need to cram everything into this one week. While it was all great, I definitely look forward to a vacation filled with less.
