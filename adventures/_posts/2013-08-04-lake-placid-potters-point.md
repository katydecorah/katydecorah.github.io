This weekend I visited my college roommate in Lake Placid. We walked around Mirror Lake once a day, ate delicious food, and people watched. It was refreshing!

On the way home, I visited my folks. Mom took me to a spot not far from home called Potter's Point. It's a short hike in the woods to a really lovely nook along the Hudson River.

I also filled my pockets with felled mini hemlock pine cones. Free craft materials!
