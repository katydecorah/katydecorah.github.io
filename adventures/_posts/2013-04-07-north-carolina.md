My sister moved to North Carolina a few years ago. Since then my folks and I make an annual trip down to visit.

This week is ceremoniously dedicated to eating a lot of food in between mom geocaching and then my sister and I binging on a tv series on Netflix. This year it was Bones.

## Snowflake

My sister's cat terrifies me.

My sister is a middle school science teacher, so we picked up these hissing Madagascar cockroaches&hellip; on purpose.
