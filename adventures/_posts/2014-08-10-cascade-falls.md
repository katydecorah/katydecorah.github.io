Yesterday morning we work up early and drove out to North Adams to explore [Cascade Falls once again](/adventures/western-mass-adventures/).

On the drive there we saw a family of black bears crossing the road. I got a quick snap of one of the babies.

We came to the falls prepared this time. We brought extra shoes, shirts, shorts, towels, and waterproof cases for our electronic devices. We were ready to storm the base of the waterfall.

The water was not raging like it was last June, which made wading to the waterfall much easier and slightly drier.

The water was cold, but it was a real treat.

After the falls we picked up whoopie pies, bread, and fresh peaches from the Williamstown Farmers&rsquo; market. Then we had an awesome late breakfast the [Chef&rsquo;s Hat Diner](http://www.chefshatdiner.com/).

We topped off the night by seeing Boyhood at the Spectrum and grabbing a slice of pizza on Lark.

Awesome day.
