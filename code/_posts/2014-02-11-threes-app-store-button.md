I recently came across the website for the app [THREES](http://asherv.com/threes/). One of my favorite parts of the website is at the bottom. As you scroll, the phone glides down the page and ends up in a pocket, where an app store button awaits you.

<p data-height="266" data-theme-id="97" data-slug-hash="dAwft" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/katydecorah/pen/dAwft'>THREES App Store Button</a> by Katy DeCorah (<a href='http://codepen.io/katydecorah'>@katydecorah</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>

I loved the button and decided to give it a spin in CSS. The demo above is scalable on `$size` and color change friendly on `$btn`.

The dimension of the button and button's shadow are created through `box-shadow`.
