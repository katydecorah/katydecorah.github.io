I've been into simple shapes lately. I found [this interesting logo](http://dribbble.com/shots/1183733-Posh-wordpress-theme-logo-design) on Dribbble and decided to try it out.

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="97" data-slug-hash="hAive" data-user="katydecorah" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/katydecorah/pen/hAive'>Triangles</a> by Katy DeCorah (<a href='http://codepen.io/katydecorah'>@katydecorah</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a></p>

I used one list item for each triangle. Each triangle has a pseudo element as its shaded triangle part. Each triangle has no width or height, instead it's shaped using border properties. I used the transform property with rotate and skew to massage each triangle into its correct orientation. (On a rainy day, I'd like to try to get the colors brighter and adjust the pseudo triangles to fit more appropriately.)

On hover the triangles become equilateral with a border-width set at `5em` (and `1em` for the pseudo triangles) and then I removed any trace of rotate or skew. I adjusted the positioning so that each triangle falls more elegantly.

Just bunch of simple shapes.
