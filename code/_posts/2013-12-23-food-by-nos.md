I coded out the Dribbble shot, [Food by nos](http://dribbble.com/shots/1355254-Food), and added some hover pizazz.

In this example, I tried to play around with flexbox. Things didn't go as expected in Firefox; I couldn't get `box-pack` to center vertically. I'll have to experiment some more to get the hang of it.
