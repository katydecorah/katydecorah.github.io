I came in second place during week one season two of the [CodePen Rodeo](http://blog.codepen.io/rodeo/season-two/)!

<p data-height="500" data-theme-id="97" data-slug-hash="HIKqE" data-user="katydecorah" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/katydecorah/pen/HIKqE'>Rodeo 5</a> by Katy DeCorah (<a href='http://codepen.io/katydecorah'>@katydecorah</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a></p>

The challenge was to typeset Shel Silverstein's poem _Hug O' War_ using only typography and color.

I knew I wanted my poem to be clean and easy to read, but I needed it to be secretly cute. For every fun verb or word (marked with a light dotted bottom border), I created a special CSS animation executed on hover. Giggles is my favorite!

I thought it was really nice how many people came out to vote!
