I created another scalable, chameleon, single element project. This is based off of the Dribbble shot, [Power Up Preloader by Mantas Ba&#269;iu&#353;ka](http://dribbble.com/shots/1399080-Power-Up-Preloader-GIF).

Hover over the battery for LIGHTNING CHARGE (please flick your lights on and off as you read this sentence).

## Elements

The main element, `.battery`, is the outline of the battery. The `:before` is the inner animating gradient and the `:after` is the battery contact.

## Make it scalable

Like my other pens, I also made this one scalable. Try changing `$size` in the Sass. I added a few conditions for when `$size` is less than `4em`, because when `$size` is teeny the positioning gets thrown off. To help it along, I added a `background-color` to `.battery` to hide the pixel misalignment.

The color of the battery and background will adjust according to `$accent`. Darkish grays look pretty dope.

## Repeating gradients repeating gradients

The magic of this whole thing is the animated gradient. The first step was creating a gradient that was a pattern. The beginning and end must match seamlessly. I carefully crafted (jk, I guessed until I got it right) the `repeating-linear-gradient` into a pattern.

    background: repeating-linear-gradient(-45deg, $bg, $bg 3%, $accent 3%, $accent 25%);

The animation moves the `background-position` of the gradient horizontally. In `@keyframes` I set `to {background-position:(($size /2) - $border) 0;}`. I used a variable here so that the gradient stays in proportion.

I coupled the `@keyframes` with `animation: charge 0.5s infinite linear;` on `:before`. Once the `background-position` gets to `(($size /2) - $border)` it runs again, but it's seamless so we can't tell.

It took me a few tries to get the `repeating-linear-gradient` just right. Gradients are so useful, but dang&hellip; I need to spend more time with them. For instance, I didn't know until about a month ago that the repeating function existed for linear and radial.

I think I'll need to do some more experiments with gradients.
