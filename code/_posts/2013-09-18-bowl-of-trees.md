I could not have made this without Haml and Sass.

<p data-height="500" data-theme-id="97" data-slug-hash="oEiCf" data-user="katydecorah" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/katydecorah/pen/oEiCf'>Bowl of Trees</a> by Katy DeCorah (<a href='http://codepen.io/katydecorah'>@katydecorah</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a></p>

This is comprised of a list with 100 list items. Each list item is styled differently. What's more, you will always get a different configuration of trees, the color of the trees, and animation speed of the trees on refresh. This is all thanks to the random() Sass function on CodePen.

At the last minute, I decided to add the dumping of the trees on hover. It passed in my mind, but once I saw it happened I squealed with glee!

So please, give the bowl a hover!

The design is inspired by [Graph #3 by Jordan Kasten-Krause](http://dribbble.com/shots/1239406).

This is one of my favorite Pens so far!
