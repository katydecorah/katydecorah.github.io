I stumbled upon "Ja!" on Pinterest over the weekend. The bright colors and striking shadow drew me in. I decided to code it out with a Sass function.

## Getting started

I started by grabbing the code from my first ever Sass function, [DotMama](/code/dots/). I striped it down and adjusted the values to output for `text-shadow`. The new function, `shadow()`, generates many, cascading shadow rules and gives the appearance of one chunky shadow.

```css
@include text-shadow(shadow(#ff5c31, 0, 0.1em));
```

The function accepts the color of the shadow, the position that the shadow should start, and the width of the shadow.

## Spinning with @while

I started by using a `@for` loop to spin out the shadow values, but it limited my desired output. I wanted the shadow to stop at specific point allowing for customized shadow thickness. With a little digging, I found that `@while` is much more suitable for this situation. I altered my function to stop adding shadow values once the `x` value of the shadow equals the value of the shadow width.

## Start shadow

I can also tell the function where I want the shadow to start. This value provides an interesting degree of depth, but I have it set to 0.

Below is a demonstration of the shadow start in use.

(Please laugh in a Spanish accent in cadence with the animation above before continuing with this post.)

## Pixels vs ems

I started out by using relative units because an `1px` increment will result in the smoothest shadow. I wanted the project to scale proportionately based on `font-size`, so I shifted the values to allow for ems.

Below, I blew up the project to show the difference between the two units. The left uses pixels and the right uses ems.

{% include img.html src="2014-05-05-ja-1.jpg" alt="px-em" width="700" height="217" %}

While the ems are less smooth, it will generate significantly less code than pixels.

{% include img.html src="2014-05-05-ja-2.jpg" alt="ja-px-em-values" width="700" height="340" %}

Using ems looks a little less romantic because the function values must be teeny decimals, but slimer, scalable code is ace.
