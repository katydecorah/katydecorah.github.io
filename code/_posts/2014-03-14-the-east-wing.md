I had a nice time chatting with Chris Enns on the East Wing!

> Chris Enns fills in again for Tim Smith and he chats with Katy DeCorah about how she got her start on the web, how her education in history and library helps with research, and what it's like developing for IE 7 in 2014.

Unfortunately, the link to the recording no longer works.
