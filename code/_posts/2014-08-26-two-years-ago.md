Two years ago on CodePen I was picked for the first time ever.

I know this because I found a screenshot on my computer a few days ago:

<div class="photos">
{% include img.html src="2014-08-26-two-years-ago-1.jpg" alt="Screen Shot 2012-08-26 at 9.24.21 PM" width="1600" height="776" %}
</div>

I took the screenshot at the time because I was shocked. Total double take. Nobody had seen something I made like _this_ before. I was just messing around. Maybe I should delete it, it's not finished. People are seeing. People will see. Hot sweat. Cold sweat. Do something.

I finished it.

After two years of getting better at CSS, learning Sass and Haml, and starting this site to write about my code, I'm so glad that I finished that little Dropbox pen.

Thank you CodePen and thank you to anyone who has ever hearted or viewed one of my pens!
