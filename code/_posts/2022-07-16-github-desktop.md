I have been using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for years now and it's one of my favorite development tools. Desktop has evolved over the years from an interface for git commands to the command center for development.

- **Project manager.** I can open terminal, my text editor, the repository on github.com, or the current branch on github.com right from Desktop.
- **Co-authors**. With one click, I can add a co-authors to one or more commits when I'm pairing or I received a suggestion from a colleague.
- **Atomic commits.** I can build up atomic commits in my pull request thanks to Desktop's tools for discarding, reordering, and squashing commits.
- **Forks.** When cloning a fork, Desktop asks if I will be contributing to the parent project or working on my own. It will then manage the fork behavior by setting the upstream branch.
- **Manage untracked changes.** When I'm working between projects and I need to switch branches, Desktop will ask if I want to bring or leave my changes. This is also helpful if I find a branch is growing to large, I can quickly switch changes to another branch.
- **Rerun checks.** Instead of switching to github.com to [rerun the checks](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/working-with-your-remote-repository-on-github-or-github-enterprise/viewing-and-re-running-checks-in-github-desktop) on a pull request, I can do it from Desktop.

My favorite part of Desktop has always been the ability to see exactly what I'm doing in a meaningful way.
