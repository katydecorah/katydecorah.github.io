After working on a feedback feature for Mapbox's documentation sites, I started collecting screenshots of how other companies offer user feedback. I decided to build a site to store them all: [Feedback Library](https://doublegreat.dev/feedback-library/)

<div class="photos">
{% include img.html src="2020-07-05-feedback-library.png" alt="" width="1600" height="974" %}
</div>

The library includes feedback features for technical documentation and product. Each post includes screenshots of the feature, explores available options, and describes the experience.

I love seeing the different ways feedback can be phrased or rated. From wondering if you _found what you are looking for_ to if you _found the page helpful_. Was the content worthy of 5 stars or one thumbs down?

I find these rating systems fascinating. I would love to learn how each company processes this feedback, but that's a project for another day.
