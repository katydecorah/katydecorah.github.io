I recreated [Leadership Letters #2. by Jeroen van Eerden](http://drbl.in/ktXg) using Hugo Giraudel's [items in a circle](http://hugogiraudel.com/2013/04/02/items-on-circle/) Sass mixin and generous use of the `border` property.

## Border control

The project has eight block elements, `.item`, nested in a container. Each `.item` is supposed to resemble the letter 'L'. (In my first commit I totally wrote that it was the number '7', re: title.) To get the shape, I assigned the top and right `border-color` colors, while I gave the bottom and left `border-color` transparent values.

<!--extra-eyes ignore previous-->At first, I didn't use the bottom or left borders at all. Instead, I used `box-shadow` to cast a white lip around the broadside of each element providing space between each `.item`. By doing that I had to increment the `z-index` to keep each element's nose underneath the previous. Unfortunately, the first element in the z-index stack was then on top of the last element. I scratched my head for a while, until I removed the `box-shadow` and clipped each element's nose with a transparent left border.

Two cheers for simple code.

## Circling

Next, I needed to get each `.item` on a circle and rotated about 45 degrees to achieve the cascading effect. I tweaked the _items on a circle_ mixin until each element fell into place. I've used the mixin before, but I must not have examined the code. I didn't realize that you can assign more than one `rotate` values in one `transform` rule. (I learned something new today _/air guitar/_).

```css
transform: rotate(0deg) translate(0.875em) rotate(45deg);
```

Using the two rotates, I balanced out the items onto the circle and then locked them into position.

## :nth-of-what

I used `:nth-of-type` to alternate the colors of my Sass list, `$colors`. I thought I had the `:nth` selector game figured out, but it took me a few tries to alternate the colors among the items.

```css
:nth-of-type(4n + 2)
:nth-of-type(4n + 3)
:nth-of-type(4n + 4)
```

The above will then compute as:

- 4 (0) + 2 = 2, 4 (1) + 2 = 6
- 4 (0) + 3 = 3, 4 (1) + 3 = 7
- 4 (0) + 4 = 4, 4 (1) + 4 = 8

(I think that this makes sense to me. Hi, I'm insecure about `:nth`.)

<!--extra-eyes ignore initial-->The first and fifth elements take the initial style from `.item`.

## Border animation

Once I had the project built out, I started playing around with a few of the properties. I found that by increasing the `border-bottom-width` each element would appear to tuck its tail in, which created a beautiful inner circle. I added an animation to bounce from sharp edges to smooth edges to capture all the shapes.
