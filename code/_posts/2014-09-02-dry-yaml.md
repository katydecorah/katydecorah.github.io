For the class that I'm teaching this Fall, I created a Jekyll site to hold the course materials. I'm in the camp that [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) can do anything and I want to use it always.

While working on variables in the config, I wondered if there's a better way to write the following:

```yaml
coursename: Intermediate Interactive Design
description: Intermediate Interactive Design, Informatics Department, University at Albany, Fall 2014
```

After some "concatenate Yaml" googling, I found that you can't concatenate, but [you can repeat nodes](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5954748).

I tidied up and followed the patterns:

```yaml
coursename: &course_name Intermediate Interactive Design
description:
  - \*course_name
  - Informatics Department
  - University at Albany
  - Fall 2014
```

Repeating nodes works by creating a keyword and placing it in the variable to be repeated. In this case, I used `&course_name`. Next, I dropped `*course_name` where I want `&course_name` to be repeated.

You set the variable with `&keyword` and recall it using `*keyword`.

> Repeated nodes (objects) are first identified by an anchor (marked with the ampersand - “&”), and are then aliased (referenced with an asterisk - “\*”) thereafter.
> <cite>&mdash; <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2760395">Yaml Spec</a></cite>

You can repeat more than one node:

```yaml
coursename: &course_name Intermediate Interactive Design
semester: &this_semester Fall 2014
description:
  - \*course_name
  - Informatics Department
  - University at Albany
  - \*this_semester
```

Now I can use either variable as I normally would and the repeated node will slide in smooth.

You might notice that I moved the `description` to an array. This gives me a little more flexibility with output.

Now I can use {% raw %}`{{ site.description | join: ", " }}`{% endraw %} or even {% raw %}`{{ site.description | join: "<br>" }}`{% endraw %} to output the array nicely.
