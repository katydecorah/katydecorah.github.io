I built [read action](https://github.com/katydecorah/read-action), a GitHub Action, that tracks the books that you've read by writing the book metadata to a yaml file. Services, like Goodreads, already exist, but I want to own my data.

## How it works

After I finish a book, I create an issue in this repository, enter the ISBN as the title, and add the `read` label. Once I open the issue, the GitHub action, kicks off.

1. The action parses the issue title to extract the ISBN.
2. Then it uses [node-isbn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-isbn) to return the metadata for the book. If I added any content to the body of the issue, the action will set it as the value of `notes` in the book entry. The action will also set the `dateFinished` to today, unless I specify a `YYYY-MM-DD` value in the title of the issue.
3. As a last step, the action fetches my repository's library ([`_data/read.yml`](https://github.com/katydecorah/katydecorah.github.io/blob/58ee03d479a7c6717df66fa4455fec2ca89ba646/_data/read.yml)), adds the book entry, orders all entries by `dateFinished`, and rewrites the file.

Finally, the workflow [commits the changes](https://github.com/katydecorah/katydecorah.github.io/blob/17b23c70f0c0be5ca7fada661ccafcbf47e44d37/.github/workflows/read.yml#L21-L26) and [closes the originating issue](https://github.com/katydecorah/katydecorah.github.io/blob/17b23c70f0c0be5ca7fada661ccafcbf47e44d37/.github/workflows/read.yml#L27-L31).

## Pair it with an iOS Shortcut

I created a [Shortcut](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334) to help me automate issue creation from my iPhone.

When I click the _Finished a book_ Shortcut, it asks me: _What's the ISBN?_, _When did you finish the book?_ and _Any notes?_ Using the responses, the shortcut will then use GitHub's [create an issue endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#create-an-issue) and open the issue in my set repository.

{% include button.html title="Add the *Finished a book* iOS Shortcut" href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f3c97ddc90fa47faa833834c17038856" %}

You will likely need to [allow untrusted shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210628) to be able to add the shortcut. As always, you should review the shortcut steps to make sure you understand all the actions it will take.

## Display your library

Since the file is a Jekyll data file, I can parse list all the books I've read this year.

{% assign sorted = site.data.read | sort: 'dateFinished' | where_exp:"item",
"item.dateFinished contains 2020" %}

<div class="books">
{% for book in sorted %}
<a href="{{book.canonicalVolumeLink}}" class="book"><img src="{{book.imageLinks.thumbnail}}" alt="{{book.title}}"></a>
{% endfor %}
</div>

I read {{sorted | size}} books in 2020 (so far).

```liquid
{% raw %}{% assign sorted = site.data.read | sort: 'dateFinished' | where_exp:"item",
"item.dateFinished contains 2020" %}

<div class="books">
  {% for book in sorted %}
    <a href="{{book.canonicalVolumeLink}}" class="book"><img src="{{book.imageLinks.thumbnail}}" alt="{{book.title}}"></a>
  {% endfor %}
</div>

I read {{sorted | size}} books in 2020 (so far).{% endraw %}
```
