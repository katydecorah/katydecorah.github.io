After creating the [CSS Diamond](../diamond/) I tried to replicate [this Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/shots/1179097-Bloombox). I created a list item for each petal. They are all ovals with transparent border-left and border-right and then rotated respectively.

<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="97" data-slug-hash="phmFj" data-user="katydecorah" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/katydecorah/pen/phmFj'>Octagon</a> by Katy DeCorah (<a href='http://codepen.io/katydecorah'>@katydecorah</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a></p>

Nothing super complicated here. It's the magic of border-radius and some transparent/opaque colors.

I starting playing around with the animation and was pleased with my result. If you view on CodePen the animation is infinite.
