I wrote [_Keep your streak in the work week_](https://superyesmore.com/keep-your-streak-in-the-work-week-42f56e22f050b235c0639d8790385151) on [The Human In The Machine](https://superyesmore.com/publication/the-human-in-the-machine-a4064599cde2cb3397239e8d72219f48) today. My article is about how I built ChillBot, a Slack bot that messages me on the weekends to let me know if I've contributed on GitHub for seven consecutive days and to encourage me to take a break.

The message looks something like this:

## How it works

1. [Fetch all my activity on GitHub](https://github.com/katydecorah/chillbot/blob/fdb408c8dbeb90181fba8a809e2f63b61305c839/index.js#L12) through the Events API. (The API only retrieves up to 300 events, so if you're a power user, the API may not retrieve enough data to decide if you have a streak or not.)
2. Get every [unique date when I did something on GitHub](https://github.com/katydecorah/chillbot/blob/fdb408c8dbeb90181fba8a809e2f63b61305c839/index.js#L22-L28).
3. Figure out [how many days I've contributed on GitHub](https://github.com/katydecorah/chillbot/blob/fdb408c8dbeb90181fba8a809e2f63b61305c839/index.js#L30-L36) by looping through every day starting with yesterday through my decided streak (7 days). And if that day matches a day that I contributed on GitHub then mark it, if it doesn't then break the loop.
4. If my streak is greater or equal to the number of days I contributed, [ping me on Slack](https://github.com/katydecorah/chillbot/blob/fdb408c8dbeb90181fba8a809e2f63b61305c839/index.js#L39-L41).

Ironically, it took a little bit to break my streak as I was working on this bot on the weekend, but I am proud of any of my gray-square weekends.

You can [check out the code on GitHub](https://github.com/katydecorah/chillbot) and [learn how to automate the bot with Amazon Web Services](https://github.com/katydecorah/chillbot/blob/master/SETUP.md) with the steps I wrote up.
