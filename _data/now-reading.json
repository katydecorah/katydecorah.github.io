Since the publication of the groundbreaking Bad Feminist and Hunger, Roxane Gay has continued to tackle big issues embroiling society—state-sponsored violence and mass shootings, women’s rights post-Dobbs, online disinformation, and the limits of empathy—alongside more individually personalized matters: can I tell my co-worker her perfume makes me sneeze? Is it acceptable to schedule a daily 8 am meeting? In her role as a New York Times opinion section contributor and the publication’s “Work Friend” columnist, she reaches millions of readers with her wise voice and sharp insights. Opinions is a collection of Roxane Gay’s best nonfiction pieces from the past ten years. Covering a wide range of topics—politics, feminism, the culture wars, civil rights, and much more—with an all-new introduction in which she reflects on the past decade in America, this sharp, thought-provoking anthology will delight Roxane Gay’s devotees and draw new readers to this inimitable talent.\",\"pageCount\":356,\"printType\":\"BOOK\",\"categories\":[\"Literary Collections\"],\"thumbnail\":\"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=kISwEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api\",\"language\":\"en\",\"link\":\"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kISwEAAAQBAJ\"}"
