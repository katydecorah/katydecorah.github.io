In this society, paranoia is well-suited because eyes and ears are all around, and they are judging. Always judging. This terrifying (and yet somehow vaguely familiar) terrain is explored via Eleanor – a young woman eagerly learning about the gifts of her magic through the support of her coven. But being a white witch is not as easy as they portray it in the books, and she’s already been placed under ‘house arrest’ with a letch named Stan, a co-worker who wronged her in the past and now exists in the form of a cat. A talking cat who loves craft beers, picket lines, and duping and ‘shooting’ people. Eleanor has no time for Stan and his shenanigans, because she finds herself helping another coven locate a missing witch which she thinks is mysteriously linked to the shortage of water in Liberty.","pageCount":267,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"thumbnail":"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=ydpHEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","language":"en","link":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ydpHEAAAQBAJ"}
